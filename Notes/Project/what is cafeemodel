A Caffe Model, often referred to as a caffemodel, is a file format associated with the Caffe deep learning framework. Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is a popular deep learning framework developed primarily for computer vision tasks. It's widely used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more.


A caffemodel file contains the learned parameters (weights and biases) of a neural network model that has been trained using the Caffe framework. These parameters are essential for making predictions on new data. The caffemodel file stores the trained parameters in a serialized format, allowing them to be loaded and utilized by the framework during inference.z
