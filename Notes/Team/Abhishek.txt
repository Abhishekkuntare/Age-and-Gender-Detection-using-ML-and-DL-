Introduction:
"Hello Sir! I worked on the part of our project that predicts age and gender. It's like teaching our project to guess how old someone is and whether they are a boy or a girl."


Responsibilities:
"My job involved taking a special tool, called a prediction model, and making sure it knows how to look at a face and tell us the age and gender. It's like giving our project the ability to make educated guesses about people."

Model Integration:
"I integrated the age and gender prediction models into our project. These models are like our project's brain for understanding more about the faces it sees. It's like adding a smart thinker to our project."
